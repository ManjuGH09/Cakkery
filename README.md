The project is all about ordering bakery items, through a website done using PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.<br/>
Customers can view the menu of all the products available, and with the support of the menu and cart option customers can order and buy the product online.<br/>
This system also has an admin where the admin can add products, delete products, and edit the details of the products. Admin can also view the number of users registered to the website, reviews, and the orders done by the customers.
